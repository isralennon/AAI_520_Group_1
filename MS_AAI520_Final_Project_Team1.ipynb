    "### Final Project - Team 1: Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System.\n",
    "#### By Manikandan Perumal & Israel Romero Olvera\n",
    "#### _________________________________________________\n",
    "#### The purpose of this final project is to build a real-world financial analysis system powered by agentic AI, with the abilities of reasoning, planning, and acting based on the user's prompt. It will coordinate multiple specialized LLM agents to handle complex financial tasks end-to-end.\n",
    "#### Our Agentic AI system was developed in a folder structure that can be found in our GitHub site: https://github.com/isralennon/AAI_520_Group_1/tree/main\n",
    "#### For delivery purposes we've condensed all the code into this document, structured the following way:\n",
    "#### 1. Tools - this section contains the code in file /modules/tools.py which will perform basic RAG connections.\n",
    "#### 2. Parser - this section contains the code in file /modules/parser.py, which provides basic functionality to parse data in JSON format.\n",
    "#### 3. Memory - this section contains the code in file /modules/memory.py that handles the storage of ongoing knowledge, to provide a robust and efficient functionality.\n",
    "#### 4. Agents - this section contains the code in file /modules/subagents.py, designed to host the definitions of the main Agent class as well as our specialized subagents - the team of agents available to the main orchestrator. We developed the following team of agents:\n",
    "#### - Orchestrator - the \"Manager\" of the Agents\n",
    "#### - News Researcher - the specialist of finding financial news, using FinnHub.\n",
    "#### - Market Researcher - the specialist of finding financial hard data like market trends, stock prices, etc.\n",
    "#### - Writer - the specialist of taking all the information and preparing a polished answer for the user\n",
    "#### 5. Main Orchestrator Agent - this section contains the code in file /modules/agent.py and has the definition for the orchestrator agent, which develops the strategy and coordinates all subagents.\n",
    "#### 6. Demo - this section contains the code in our main notebook, /main.ipynb - our implementation file where we execute all the above with demonstration purposes.\n",
    "#### _________________________________________________\n",
    "### 1. TOOLS.\n",
    "#### One of the four agent functions we'll implement is the usage of tools, which will be defined in this first section."

The strong demand for the iPhone 17 also indicates continued consumer interest in its core product lines. Coupled with a slight increase in its stock price from $254.04 on October 17, 2025, to $255.74 on October 18, 2025, there are indications of ongoing positive momentum.\\n\\nHowever, potential investors should also consider the challenges. Some analysts express caution regarding future iPhone models' expectations, suggesting that long-term growth might face headwinds. Furthermore, Apple is currently under legal scrutiny concerning chip royalties and data collection practices, which could introduce regulatory risks and potential financial impacts. When making investment decisions, it's crucial to balance these growth catalysts with the potential risks and to conduct thorough personal research.\""
